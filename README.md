# resume-builder

Fills a clean, simple resume template with user-defined information, with an option to print/save to PDF. ATS-friendly. Built with ReactJS, styled components, react icons (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons), ReactToPrint (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-print), and uuid for sample key ids (https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid).

Goal: make it good enough so that I can use it personally on job applications soon!
